# NewYouTubePlay

## Concept
Its a music streaming app. It's basically Youtube without the video. 

## Features
* Users can search any artist,songs, albums and, using the ###Youtube search API###, results are fetched.
* Users can then either
  * Play the song directly
  * Add it to new playlist
  * Add it to the existing playlist.
* Only the audio is streamed and not the video

## What is so special?
* Youtube API's make it mandatory to show video if we are using them.
* But most of the time, video is not needed and we just keep the videos running in the background and only listen to the song.
* This app makes extracts only the audio link by some algorithm and plays it in the .mp3 format.
